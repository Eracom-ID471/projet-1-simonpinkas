              [Verse 1]</br>
              Well, I don't like talkin’ to myself</br>
              But someone's gotta say it, hell</br>
              I mean, things have not been going well</br>
              This time I think I finally fucked myself</br>
              You see, the life I live is sickening</br>
              I spent a decade playing chicken with oblivion</br>
              Day to day, I'm neck and neck with giving in</br>
              I’m the same old wreck I've always been</br>
            </p>
            <p>
              [Chorus]</br>
              And when I see her in the park</br>
              It barely merits a remark</br>
              How we stand the standard distance</br>
              Distant strangers stand apart</br>

            <p>
              [Verse 2]</br>
              Course I've been humbled by the void</br>
              Much of my faith has been destroyed</br>
              I've been forced to watch my foes enjoy</br>
              Ceaseless feasts of schadenfreude</br>
              And as the pace of life keeps quickening</br>
              Beneath the bitching and the bickering</br>
              When I try to drown my thoughts in gin</br>
              I find my worst ideas know how to swim</br>
            </p>
            <p>[Chorus]</br>
              Well, a setback can be a setup</br>
              For a comeback if you don't let up</br>
              But this kind of hurtin' won't heal</br>
              And the end of all wanting</br>
              Is all I've been wanting</br>

              I nearly lost my genitalia</br>

          [Chorus]
          Well, a setback can be a setup
          For a comeback if you don't let up
          But this kind of hurtin' won't heal
          And the end of all wanting
          Is all I've been wanting
          And that’s just the way that I feel

          [Verse 3]
          I met failure in Australia
          I fell ill in Illinois
          I nearly lost my genitalia
          To an anthill in Des Moines
          I was so far gone in Fargo
          South Dakota got annoyed
          That’s the shit I'm talkin’ 'bout
          When I talk to you about
          Ceaseless feasts of schadenfreude

          [Chorus]
          And a setback can be a setup
          For a comeback if you don't let up
          But this kind of hurtin' won’t heal
          And the end of all wanting
          Is all I've been wanting
          The end of all wanting
          Is all I've been wanting
          The end of all wanting
          Is all I've been wanting
          And that's just the way that I feel

          [Verse 1]
          Well, I don't like talkin’ to myself
          But someone's gotta say it, hell
          I mean, things have not been going well
          This time I think I finally fucked myself
          You see, the life I live is sickening
          I spent a decade playing chicken with oblivion
          Day to day, I'm neck and neck with giving in
          I’m the same old wreck I've always been

          [Chorus]
          And when I see her in the park
          It barely merits a remark
          How we stand the standard distance
          Distant strangers stand apart

          [Verse 2]
          Course I've been humbled by the void
          Much of my faith has been destroyed
          I've been forced to watch my foes enjoy
          Ceaseless feasts of schadenfreude
          And as the pace of life keeps quickening
          Beneath the bitching and the bickering
          When I try to drown my thoughts in gin
          I find my worst ideas know how to swim


          [Chorus]
          Well, a setback can be a setup
